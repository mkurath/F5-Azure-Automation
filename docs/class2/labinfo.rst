Lab Network Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Connect to Lab Environment 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to Figure 1. We are simulating internal and external access
to VDI with 2 Windows desktops. When viewing the “corporate-pc” session,
imagine you are sitting at your office desk. Likewise, viewing the
“home-pc” session is like you are sitting at home, or anywhere outside
of the company network.

The lab is hosted in a cloud provider Ravello. Lab instructors will
provide a URL and a unique student number to access the environment.
Each attendee is expected to have a computer with a modern browser and a
RDP client.

1. Open browser and go to the URL provided by instructor.

2.  Choose to connect with RDP.
   Leave this connection for entire lab duration.
